# metatext

**Make anything an AI writes read like a real document — not like an AI answering a prompt.**

AI deliverables leak *metatext*: the output talks about itself, the request, the options it weighed, or the person who asked — instead of just being the thing. A report opens with an eyebrow label. An email arrives as three versions to "pick from." A contract invents a reference number. A function carries a comment addressed to you. None of it is what a competent professional would have handed over.

`metatext` is a skill for Claude Code and compatible agent harnesses that strips all of it — first by making the agent register the real job (what the artifact is, who it is for, what it is *for*), then by cutting every trace of the prompt-and-AI situation from the result.

## The shift

**What an agent hands you:**

> **ELEVATOR PITCH**
>
> Hi! I've written three versions so you can pick the tone that fits — short, formal, and warm. Let me know if you'd like changes!
>
> *Version 1 (short):* We help dental clinics reduce missed appointments using automated reminders...
>
> *Disclaimer: nothing here constitutes financial advice.*

**After metatext:**

> We cut dental-clinic no-shows by 40% with a single text message. Three hundred clinics, $2M in annual revenue, growing 15% a month. We're raising a seed round to reach the next three thousand.

The first is a chat reply *about* a pitch. The second is the pitch.

## How it works

The test: *could this be handed to its real audience exactly as is, with zero surrounding explanation — and would a human expert in this genre have written it the same way?* If not, something is leaking. Cut until yes.

Two moves:

1. **Register the real job** — the artifact (the real-world object, not the prompt category), the audience (who receives it, not who asked), the intended nature (what it is *for*, and whether the content actually does that), and the exemplar (what a real instance contains, and what it never contains). Get this right and most metatext never appears.
2. **Produce clean, then strip** — write it as the professional would, then cut every self-reference, option menu, disclaimer, eyebrow, and out-of-scope addition a real instance would not carry.

## What's in here

- **`SKILL.md`** — the procedure: the core test, the two layers (sentence- and artifact-level), the causal model, and an adversarial audit mode.
- **`reference/taxonomy.md`** — the worked catalogue: every pattern with before/after fixes, used as an audit checklist.
- **`reference/grounding.md`** — the published research behind the causal model (reward-model length bias, sycophancy, over-caution, ambiguity under-resolution, format and persona leakage), with citations.

## Install

Skills auto-load from the skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paperfoot/metatext ~/.claude/skills/metatext
```

The agent loads it on demand when a task involves producing or auditing a deliverable, or on triggers like "check for metatext" or "make this a standalone document."

## Scope

`metatext` handles scope, self-reference, and intent — does this artifact exist for the right reader, in the right shape, at all? It composes with, but is distinct from, tone-and-restraint discipline for sensitive correspondence and sentence-level de-AI-ing for rhythm and word choice. Run it first.
