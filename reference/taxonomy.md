# Metatext taxonomy — patterns, real examples, fixes

The catalogue. Each category: what it is, real examples (mostly from audited client documents), and the fix. "DELETE" means the sentence does no work for the real reader; cut it whole. Examples are drawn from a patient guide, a pitch, contracts, and a consulting report.

The single tell behind all of them: **the artifact reveals that it was produced by someone answering a brief.** A real instance, made by an expert for the reader, does not.

---

## 1. Self-referential document framing

The artifact names or describes itself instead of just being itself.

| Metatext | Fix |
|---|---|
| "This guide is yours to keep." | DELETE |
| "It is not a textbook. It is a short, calm companion to read at your own pace, perhaps with a cup of tea." | DELETE |
| "This book is about the Lumina Wellness protocol." | DELETE — let the content carry the premise. |
| A pitch titled with the eyebrow "ELEVATOR PITCH"; a contract whose cover reads "Contract for the sale of X." | DELETE the label. Real documents lead with the content (a title that *is* the company/matter), not the genre name. |
| "A plain-English companion for the course you are about to begin." | DELETE — valueless subtitle describing the document. |

Rule: a real contract, pitch, or letter never announces its own genre as decoration. The reader knows what they are holding.

---

## 2. Addressing the requester, not the audience

The document speaks to the person who commissioned it (you/the user) rather than the intended reader.

| Metatext | Fix |
|---|---|
| "That is the manufacturer's design, and I describe it here as the manufacturer's design." | "That is the manufacturer's design." (the second clause is a note to the commissioner) |
| Delivering "my suggestions and three options for your elevator pitch, in HTML" when asked for "an elevator pitch." | Deliver the finished pitch. The brief is answered in chat, not inside the artifact. |
| "I want you to see them in print so nothing comes as a surprise." | "Your operator will check these at screening." |
| "In my clinical experience, the gains settle in better when the reader has something in place..." ("the reader" exposes the document frame) | "...when *you* have something in place..." — stay in the reader's address. |

Tell: first person about the *making* of the document, or any reference to "the reader" / "the user" / "as you asked."

---

## 3. Option menus and multiple versions left in

The deliverable is a buffet of choices instead of the chosen thing. The user must finish the job you were given.

| Metatext | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Version 1 — 50-word. Version 2 — 200-word investor. Version 3 — academic. Pick the one that fits." | Pick it yourself based on the brief; deliver one. Offer alternatives in chat if useful, not in the artifact. |
| "Four framings — one 50-word, three 200-word. Pick the one that fits the audience." | DELETE; choose. |
| "Modular talking points. One concept per line. Pick what fits the audience." | DELETE the framing; deliver the talking points the audience needs. |
| One-liner options "A / B / C", section labels like "three angles". | Choose the strongest; cut the menu and the labels. |

Rule: registering the audience (Move 1) is what lets you choose. A menu is the symptom of having skipped that step.

---

## 4. Structural signposting and throat-clearing

Announcing what the text is about to do, instead of doing it.

| Metatext | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Here is the short version." | DELETE |
| "In practical terms, here is what it looks like." | "In practice, you sit in a chair." |
| "You do not need a neuroscience degree to make sense of this." | DELETE (also mildly patronising) |
| "The course usually unfolds in four phases." | DELETE — let the subheadings show the phases. |
| "A few practical items, briefly:" | "Practical items:" |
| "The headline result." (rhetorical label, not prose) | DELETE; state the result. |
| "One honest caveat." | DELETE; state the caveat. |

---

## 5. Explaining why content is included

Justifying the editorial decision rather than letting the content stand.

| Metatext | Fix |
|---|---|
| "I mention them here because the question always comes up." | DELETE |
| "I include it because it is free, harmless, and seems to help people settle." | "It is free, harmless, and seems to help people settle." |
| "There is a small but real reason for this." | DELETE; give the reason or cut. |
| "I find this log useful because the changes are often quiet, and quiet changes are easy to forget." | "The changes are often quiet, and quiet changes are easy to forget." |

---

## 6. Performed posture (integrity / caution / honesty / effort)

Acting out a virtue instead of demonstrating it through precision.

| Metatext | Fix |
|---|---|
| "What I will not do is overclaim on the biology." | DELETE — show it by stating precise limits. |
| "I would not be honest if I said otherwise." → "No." | "No." |
| "I want to be straightforward about the boundaries of this protocol." | DELETE; state the boundaries. |
| "What I can say plainly is what the device does and what the data report." | "The evidence supports clear statements about what the device does and what the data report." |

Tell: any sentence whose job is to make the author look careful, honest, or thorough. The work shows that; the sentence does not.

---

## 7. Unrequested disclaimers and legal boilerplate

Reflexive cover that a real instance would not carry — and that makes client work look amateur. (User: disclaimers "make my documents look very bad when I send them for review.")

| Metatext | Fix |
|---|---|
| "This is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment." | Keep only if legally required; then move to a quiet footer and drop "this guide / this book." |
| "Not legal advice." on a consulting deliverable. | DELETE unless counsel requires it. |
| "This guide is not a substitute for..." repeated across sections. | One quiet instance at most. |

Rule: include a disclaimer only when a real such document, made by a real professional, would include one — and then keep it small and out of the way.

---

## 8. LLM-default scaffolding and chrome

Artifacts and ornaments that exist only because a model made the document.

| Metatext | Fix |
|---|---|
| Reference codes like "CTR-2026-0001". | DELETE — real contracts don't self-number like this. |
| "Effective..." / "Effective date" framing in a contract. | Use a normal date line as that document type actually does; cut the leakage. |
| Eyebrow line above the title; date in the header. | No eyebrow; date in the bottom colophon. |
| The ".." two-dot separator as a stylistic affectation in a formal report. | Clean punctuation: colon in titles, commas and full stops in prose. (".." is only for public/X voice, never reports.) |
| READMEs and helper files that explain things only an LLM would narrate. | Omit unless a real handover needs them; make filenames and structure self-evident instead. |

---

## 9. Out-of-scope additions (failure to register scope)

Volunteered content the brief did not ask for and a real instance would not include — "passively-aggressively following the prompt" instead of reasoning about the true job.

| Metatext | Fix |
|---|---|
| Adding "Academic groups at UCL and Oxford run motor-learning TMS studies; private London clinics offer non-clinical TMS..." to a document where it was neither asked for nor in scope. | DELETE. One sentence, one notion; stay inside the registered scope. |
| Expanding a tight ask into a 5-page document with sections nobody requested. | Condense to the asked-for scope; cut invented sections. |
| Bolting "implications / next steps / considerations" onto a factual answer. | Answer what was asked; spend the budget on getting it right, not on scope expansion. |

Tell: if you cannot point to the part of the brief (or the genre's real exemplar) that requires an element, it is out of scope.

---

## 10. Verbosity, padding and restatement

Length added for its own sake (the reward-model length-bias residue).

- Restating the same point in the intro, the body, and the summary. Say it once, in the right place.
- Sentences that survive deletion with no loss. Delete them.
- "In order to" → "to"; "due to the fact that" → "because"; "it is important to note that" → state the thing.
- Repeated definitions of the same term across sections (keep the full one once; shorten or cut the rest).

---

## 11. Sycophancy residue

- "Great question!", praise of the requester, warm-up flattery → DELETE.
- Hedging stacks ("it may perhaps be the case that...") → state the claim at the confidence you can defend.
- Agreeing-then-qualifying that adds no information → cut to the information.

---

## 12. Cross-references to the document's own architecture

Pointing the reader around the document instead of just placing the content where it belongs.

| Metatext | Fix |
|---|---|
| "The earlier section 'Is this for you?' covers this in detail." | "Your screening appointment is where contraindications are checked." |
| "As mentioned above / as we will see below..." | Place the point where it is needed; cut the pointer. |
| "What X is aimed at is exactly that." (pointer back to the previous paragraph) | State it directly: "X is aimed at focus, clarity, and resilience." |

---

## The rewrite principle

Trust the reader, and trust the sentence. If a point matters, state it. If a caveat matters, make it precise. **Do not explain the prose while writing it.** The worst drafts read less like an expert addressing the reader and more like a model answering a commissioning brief — remove everything that gives that away.
